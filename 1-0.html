   You shake your head and take a step back as the wizard approaches you with his quest. You've heard about these types of quests before and know they never end well. No amount of treasure or fame is worth risking your life for.

"I'm sorry, but I must decline your offer," you say firmly. "I value my life too much to take on a dangerous quest like this."

The wizard's face falls and he sighs in disappointment. "I understand your hesitation, but please reconsider. The fate of the kingdom rests on this quest. Without your help, who knows what will happen."

You stand your ground, not willing to be swayed by the wizard's words. "I'm sorry, but my answer is still no. I wish you luck in finding someone else to take on your quest."

The wizard nods and turns away, his shoulders drooping in defeat. You watch as he disappears into the forest, feeling a pang of guilt wash over you. But you know in your heart that you made the right decision. You won't risk your life for a quest, no matter how noble the cause may be.

You refused the wizard's quest. You spend the rest of your life wondering what might have been if you'd only taken the chance.
